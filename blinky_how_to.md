## 1. Build normal blinky

- install Nerves per https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/installation.html
- make sure homebrew is current
  * $ brew update
- load dependencies
  * $ brew install fwup squashfs coreutils xz
  * $ mix local.hex
  * $ mix local.rebar
- install nerves
  * $ mix archive.install hex nerves_bootstrap
- create local copy of blinky
  * $ mix nerves.new blinky
  * or can copy from this repo subdir blink1/blinky
- get blinky dependencies
  * $ cd blinky
  * $ MIX_TARGET=rpi0 mix deps.get
- build nerves_firmware
  * $ MIX_TARGET=rpi0 mix firmware
- insert microSD into build computer
- burn microSD
  * $ MIX_TARGET=rpi0 mix firmware.burn
- load card, power, watch led blink once booted
  * connect hdmi if want to watch bootup
- if used blinky from this repo, change blink pattern in @durations in blinky/lib/blinky.ex

## 2. Create SBoM for blinky
- get sbom for HEX
  * $ mix archive.install hex sbom
- get dependencies
  * $ MIX_TARGET=rpi0 mix deps.get
- make sbom
  * $ mix sbom.cyclonedx -o blinky_bom.xml

XML file created is [here](blinky_bom.xml).

[myxml.escript](myxml.escript) is a quick hack to strip out the packages
which are shown [here](blinky_pkglist.txt).

Two things worth noting:
1. Only the dependencies are shown - not the actual blinky code itself. Ie. it shows the packages loaded but not the files compiled. It presumes you know those.
2. It shows all the dependencies - even the ones you don't use. Nerves has different "system" packages for the different target systems (Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspbery Pi 3, Beagleboard, ...) of which only one is loaded onto any given microSD for a specific board.

ssh into blinky assuming you set up your ssh keys (defaults to build machine's key).
- h(Toolshed) for helper commands
- tree yields the [entire file structure](blinky-file-tree.txt)
- RingLogger gives logging info

### 2.1 RPi Zero Gadget
create sd card per https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_init_gadget

- assume nerves installed per blinky first few steps
- check archive is up to date
  * mix local.nerves
- Create a new project using the generator
  * mix nerves.new mygadget --init-gadget
- cd mygadget
- get dependencies
  * MIX_TARGET=rpi0 mix deps.get
- build
  * MIX_TARGET=rpi0 mix firmware
- Copy the firmware to a MicroSD card (should find it if you have one mounted)
  * MIX_TARGET=rpi0 mix firmware.burn
- install MicroSD card in RPi Zero
- power it up via usb (make sure to use usb, not power jack)
- After 5-10 seconds, the light will blink pattern per code
- you can ssh into this card from the computer you are attached to using the ssh keys of the computer that built the firmware

This is MicroSD Yellow-1.

### 2.2 RPi 4 Gadget
do same for RPi 4 (ie use MIX_TARGET=rpi0)

### 2.3 NeoPixel LED strip
How to wire
- https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-wiring

chip to convert 3.3V (RPi) to 5V (LED)
- https://www.adafruit.com/product/1787

wire breadboard (and then protoboard) via
- https://core-electronics.com.au/tutorials/ws2812-addressable-leds-raspberry-pi-quickstart-guide.html
- https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=231971

### 2.x Sanity test SBOM
applications.started_...


## 3. Add networking
based on https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_examples/tree/master/hello_wifi

## 4. Add "Generic" Phoenix
Before customizing into an OpenC2 interface, first put a vanilla Phoenix webserver.

Start by ignoring blinky/SBOM and just make phoenix from example - https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_examples/tree/master/hello_phoenix

Then combine with previous work

## 5. OpenC2 Phoenix API
Customize the Phoenix webserver for a mimimalistic OpenC2 API.

Start by ignoring previous steps and make OC2 server on your laptop using https://github.com/sparrell/openc2-lycan-beam/tree/master/haha/elixir which is in the elixir programming language using Phoenix webserver running on BEAM.

Next step is putting this server on a RPi.

Final step is combining with the previous work

## 6. Custom OpenC2 API
Instead of using Phoenix, use a minimalistic howegrown API (future work)
